                    <h3>Breaking any of the below rules can result in a vacation or a permanent ban depending on the severity of the situation. This will be determined by admins/owners of the server.</h3>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>DISCORD NAME</h4>
                    Must include your characters name(s). We do a weekly purge of people who do not abide by this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>NO META GAMING</h4>
                    Meta gaming is taking any 3rd party or out of character information that you obtain and using it in character. {This includes information from streams, DM's, word-of-mouth & out-of-the-city etc.} 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>VALUE OF LIFE</h4>
                    You are to value your life in the city. If you are injured, take the injuries seriously. Don't do anything you wouldn't do in real life. {If you are in Pillbox multiple times a night after sustaining multiple major injuries, that's not okay. }
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>NO RDM</h4>
                    Random Death Match is killing someone without reason, and without any valid RP purpose. You cannot go around killing people for no reason, and without warning. Something must be said to someone and you must have a valid RP reason to shoot at, or kill a player. {Sniping someone from a distance when you are not in earshot is RDM.}
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>NO VDM</h4>
                    Vehicle Death match is when a player kills you with a vehicle for no reason. This includes running people over for no reason, ramming a vehicle with another vehicle to cause it to explode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>NO FAIL RP</h4>
                    Fail RP is failing to stay in character or doing something you would not do in real life. If you are about to do something in character, ask yourself "would I do this in real life?" and if the answer is no, then you should not do it. { Also, make sure to act within your character's perspective. You shouldn't be doing things that do not line up with who your character is.}
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>NLR</h4>
                    The new life rule states that when you are downed, and require an airlift, you do not remember the events that happened prior to you being downed. If you are downed and EMS shows up in time to save you or if a friend takes you to Pillbox to check-in you remember the last 10 minutes leading up to you being downed. { If you are dropped in the ocean, etc you shouldn't be using /911, but bleed out and forget said events. }
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>MAXIMUM AMOUNT PER GROUP</h4>
                    No more than 4 people allowed working on any illegal activities. (This also includes outside communication from someone as well, not just in your car)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>OUTSIDE COMMUNICATION</h4>
                    While in the city, communication is to be kept inside of the city. There is to be no outside communication via Discord, or any other platforms. (Meta Gaming)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>BUG ABUSING/EXPLOITING</h4>
                    Any bugs found out by players are to be :reported :immediately. Anyone found abusing/exploiting bugs will be permanently banned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>OFFENSIVE ROLEPLAY</h4>
                    This includes being racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. Your characters are not to be attacking anyone for their race, sexual preference, or gender. This is inexcusable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>APPLICATIONS</h4>
                    Show us that you want to RP and build your character and create stories with other people in the city. Don't expect to be accepted if your application has no effort or interest put into it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>GREEN ZONES</h4>
                    A green zone is any area where there is legal business taking place. These areas are :not to be used for criminal activity whatsoever. Shooting is :strictly-prohibited in these areas as well.
